// We need to add certain functionalities to the DOM involving different classes, elements and id using JS, that is called DOM Manipulation

// DOM Tree refers to the HTML page where all the nodes are objects. There can be 3 types of nodes in the DOM tree-
// a) Text nodes
// b) Element nodes
// c) Comment nodes

// In an HTML page, <html> is at the root and <head> and <body> are its children. A text node is always a leaf of the tree.

// document.head - gives the entire header
// document.body - gives the entire body
// document.documentElement - gives the entire html

// Note - document.body can sometimes be null if the javascript is written before the body tag
