// An event is a signal that something has happened. All the DOM nodes generate such signals. Some important DOM events are - 

// Mouse Events - click, context menu(right click), mouseover/mouseout, mousedown/mouseup, mousemove
// Keyboard Events - keydown and keyup
// Form Element Events - submit, focus
// Document Events - DocumentContentLoad

// We can specify onclick with an element in the html element itself
